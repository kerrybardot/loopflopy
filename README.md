# loopflopy

This is some useful code that stitches together LoopStructural and MODFLOW (Flopy). 
It allows multiple realisations of structural models using structural parameters and automatic updating of the flow model.
I have developed this in my PhD (finished in 2025) and still chipping away at it in my spare time.
Happy for contributers! There are always more things to improve and hopefully not too much to fix.
Please contact me if you're using it - happy to help! kerry.bardot@uwa.edu.au
